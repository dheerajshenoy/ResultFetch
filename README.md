# ResultFetch
A python program to fetch semester exam results from my university website. Based on selenium library

## Programs

1. fetch.py - program that fetches result
2. fetch_pandas.py - similar to fetch.py, but instead of manually managing the student record, this used PANDAS library
3. fetch_pandas_threading.py - fetch_pandas.py + ability to fetch multiple semester results at the same time using **threads**
